        <h2>Why I Chose to Redesign This ðŸ¤­ </h2>
        <ol>
        <li><strong> Lots of disorganized text </strong><br/>
        The large mass of disorganized text is overwhelming and confusing, encouraging users not to read it before logging in which risk missing important application related information. 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Distrustful design</strong><br/>
        The design doesnâ€™t match existing MIT webpages, so it is confusing to users who donâ€™t know if they can trust it or if they are applying in the right place.</li>

        <li><strong>Lack of context aware design</strong><br/>
        Stress, nerves, and time-crunches are a regular part of the application process. The lack of visual flow compounds these challenges rather than alleviating them, forcing users to choose between reading all of the disorganized text or risk missing important information. Designing for users who are under stress or who may be trying to access the log in page in a hurry requires special design consideration that this interface lacks.</li>

        <h2>Analyzing Problems with the Efficiency, Learnability, and Memorability ðŸ¤” </h2>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> is difficult because...<br/>
        Disorganized text impairs visual flow and navigation. 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Learnability</strong> is hindered...<br/>
        Since this webpage has differences from the rest of MITâ€™s web interfaces, users' mental models of what MIT  content looks like is confused when they look at this. Users may struggle to trust the webpage or adjust their mental model. </li>

        <li><strong>Memorability</strong> is challenged since...<br/>
        The application page content doesn't have a clear call to action, and the log-in section is not explicit</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">

      
      <h2>Design Goals ðŸŒ± </h2>
      <p>To improve this, I sought to create a design that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            Allows users quickly find relevant sections by adding clear headings to text sections
            </li>
            <li>Improve usability by making the log-in process intuitive with a clearly labeled section </li>
            <li> Builds trust by matching the aesthetic of other MIT websites</li>
            <li>Improves accessiblity by being  responsive to different layouts</li>
            <li>Is accessible by design, as measured by strong performance on the WAVE accessibilty checker</li>
